# Graphics
This folder stores graphics I have personally made/ones I upload temporarily for storage - these are not referenced anywhere in the code, all assets referenced in the code are in *./app* and your emulator folder will be able to be set up anywhere on the sytem though it is *./Emulators* by default.
